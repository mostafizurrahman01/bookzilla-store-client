Hello,
This is full stack web app. On this website, there have some
interesting features. Some of these features are a Dynamic home page,Orders Page,
Authentication System, Admin System, Deals page etc. An admin can update some of the features or include and also can delete. Anyone when a buyer click the buys now option, all of
the information will conserve in our database. So, that is some explanation and definitely, it will
not provide you a 100% service. It's always updateable by our admin.
